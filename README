System requirements:

* Linux 2.6.29 or later
* Header files and compiler for kernel compilation.
  In Ubuntu 22.04 e.g. this is accomplished by issuing the command:

    "sudo apt-get install build-essential"

  On some systems you may also need to issue:

    "sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`"

  NOTE! Having versions of the linux headers installed other than that of
        the currently running kernel may cause conflicts and faulty drivers.

* pkg-config
  To install pkg-config on Ubuntu:

    "sudo apt-get install pkg-config"

* DKMS if you want to the drivers to be built whenever the kernel is upgraded.
  To install dkms on Ubuntu:

    "sudo apt-get install dkms"


Compilation:

  NOTE! Choose a path that doesn't contain any spaces for CANlib to build properly.

* To build all drivers:

    "make"

  To install all drivers:

    "sudo make install"

  Note: it is advised to call "sudo make uninstall" before replacing installed
        drivers.

  To unload and uninstall all drivers:
    "sudo make uninstall"

  To install and load, virtual and PCI drivers:
    "sudo make load"

  Note: running "sudo make load" will also cause the virtual and PCI drivers to
        be loaded at boot time. This might be bad if experimenting with the
        device drivers.

  Note: it is never required to manually install or load any modules, create or
        edit files. This is taken care of the Makefile, in the root of the
        linuxcan directory.

  Note: if there are multiple versions of linuxcan installed for different linux
        headers, it is possible to remove them all by calling "sudo make purge".

  Another way to install CANlib is by using DKMS which automatically recompiles
  and reinstalls the CANlib drivers after a kernel upgrade.

  To build and install CANlib and all drivers using DKMS:

    "make dkms"

    "sudo make dkms_install"

  Note: this requires you to have dkms installed.

  To uninstall CANlib and to unload and uninstall all linuxcan DKMS modules:

    "sudo make dkms_uninstall"

* To build just a single driver, go to the corresponding subdirectory:

    "make"
    "sudo ./installscript.sh"

  Note: All device drivers use the kvcommon driver. If you want to build and
        install only particular device drivers, you will first need to build and
        install the kvcommon driver from the linuxcan/common directory using the
        method above.

* To build and load just a single driver (virtual or PCI), go to the
  corresponding subdirectory:

    "make"
    "sudo ./installscript.sh load"

  Note: See the note above, regarding the kvcommon driver.

* To build with debug printouts, and include gdb debug information on generated binaries:

    "make KV_DEBUG_ON=1"

Debug levels and some other settings may be changed in config.mak.


Usage:

* USBcanII, Leaf and Mhydra will load/unload when inserting/removing the device
* For PCI-drivers (pciefd, pcican, and pcicanII), use modprobe to load and
  unload the drivers, e.g.:
    "modprobe pcican" to load pcican driver, and
    "modprobe -r pcican" unload pcican driver.
* Try examples in /usr/doc/canlib/examples/

NOTE! Please read ReleaseNotes before using the driver.


Troubleshooting:

* See doc/faq


Installed Files:

* Driver modules
----------------------------------
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvpciefd.ko     (PCIEcan)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvpcican.ko     (PCIcan)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvpcicanII.ko   (PCIcanII)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvvirtualcan.ko (Virtualcan)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/misc/usbcanII.ko (USBcanII)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/misc/leaf.ko     (Leaf)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/misc/mhydra.ko   (Mhydra)

* SocketCAN module blacklisting
----------------------------------
When installing modules for devices that got SocketCAN support, the
corresponding SocketCAN module gets blacklisted.
This is done via config files put in /etc/modprobe.d:
  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kvaser_pci.conf
  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kvaser_pciefd.conf
  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kvaser_usb.conf

* Module loading
----------------------------------
Kvaser USB modules are automatically loaded by the kernel, when a matching
interface is plugged in.

For PCI based interfaces and virtual devices, the modules needs to be
loaded manually with modprobe.

Use modprobe -r <module name> to unload modules.

* Module loading at boot
----------------------------------
If the modules are installed with "sudo make load", one config file is created
for each non-USB module, in /etc/modules-load.d:
  /etc/modules-load.d/kvaser-kvpcican.conf
  /etc/modules-load.d/kvaser-kvpcicanII.conf
  /etc/modules-load.d/kvaser-kvpciefd.conf
  /etc/modules-load.d/kvaser-kvvirtualcan.conf
This will cause the modules to be loaded at boot time.

* Include files for canlib library
----------------------------------
/usr/include/canlib.h
/usr/include/canstat.h

* Canlib library and links
----------------------------------
/usr/lib/libcanlib.so
